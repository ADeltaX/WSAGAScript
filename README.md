# IT'S **WIP**

# This readme is being updated frequently. As I am aware that it might not be completely clear right now, I am going to resolve it ASAP.

Powershell script for automatically doing most of the works: [WSAGApp_PowershellScript](https://github.com/RikaKagurasaka/WSAGApp_PowershellScript). Still need testing.

## SIGN-IN ISN'T WORKING CURRENTLY. (UNLESS YOU ARE USING THE FIX GIVEN AT THE BOTTOM)

### THIS IS FOR TESTING

### Download msixbundle (~1.2GB)

Use this [link](https://store.rg-adguard.net/) to download the msixbundle with the settings ProductId: 9P3395VX91NR, Ring: SLOW

### Install WSL2

Ubuntu is used in this guide, but any other distro will work for this just fine.

(We are assuming that you are using the exact terminal, and you are also continuing this from where the last command has been left off)

### Install unzip lzip

For Ubuntu

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install unzip lzip
```

### Download gapps

Select Platform: x86_64 if Windows architecture is x64, otherwise choose ARM64, Android: 11 and Variant: Pico on [OpenGApps](https://opengapps.org/)

### Extract msixbundle

Download 7zip or a similar archival program and open the recently downloaded msixbundle. Find the msix file inside the msixbundle relating to your architecture and extract that to a folder.
Delete the files appxblockmap, appxsignature and \[content_types\] along with the folder appxmetadata.

### Clone this repo and populate the directories

For Ubuntu

```
git clone https://github.com/ADeltaX/WSAGAScript
cd WSAGAScript/\#IMAGES
mv /mnt/path-to-extracted-msix/*.img .
cd ../\#GAPPS
cp /mnt/path-to-downloaded-gapps/*.zip .
```

paths in wsl follow the same as windows after /mnt/ its just the drive letter then folder structure as normal. For example /mnt/c/users would be the c:\users folder

### Edit scripts

Set executable permission for the scripts

```
cd ..
sudo chmod +x extract_gapps_pico.sh
sudo chmod +x extend_and_mount_images.sh
sudo chmod +x apply.sh
sudo chmod +x unmount_images.sh
```

Change the root directory in VARIABLES.sh

```
pwd
```

(take note of the output)

```
nano VARIABLES.sh
```

replace the root variable with the output of pwd up until and including the WSAGAScript folder

**Debian WSL users need to create an mtab symlink:**
```
sudo ln -s /proc/self/mounts /etc/mtab
```

### Run the scripts

```
sudo ./extract_gapps_pico.sh
sudo ./extend_and_mount_images.sh
sudo ./apply.sh
sudo ./unmount_images.sh
```

### Copy the edited images

```
cd \#IMAGES
cp *.img /mnt/path-to-extracted-msix/
```

### Register the edited WSA

- Enable developer mode in windows settings.
- Uninstall any other installed versions of WSA
- Open powershell as admin and run `Add-AppxPackage -Register path-to-extracted-msix\AppxManifest.xml`

WSA will install with gapps

# WORKAROUND FOR SIGN-IN ISSUE:

## (ADB SHELL ROOT WITH su)

Copy the kernel file from this repo and replace the kernel file inside the `Tools` folder of your extracted msix (make sure WSA is not running)

This will allow you to use use `su` inside the adb shell.

Enter into the adb shell and run the following commands

```
su
setenforce 0
```

You can sign in successfully from now on.
